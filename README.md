## Project Proposal
For the end assignment of PHP I want to create a website for people that are into gardening. 
Growing your own fruit, vegetables and herbs are a great way to save some money and are good to reduce waste. But it can be hard to start with the gardening, especially when to seeds certain seeds. Therefore website will guide you through the seeding process. When to start, what you need and when you can expect to harvest. Seeding can be a lot of work and there are a lot of things that you have to take in account, such as the season and climate. Because of this the website will allow users to create an account. The account will have an option to check schedule for the users which will be a calendar for the upcomming months. Users will be able to see all sorts of fruits, vegetables and herbs that can be grown outside in their garden (according to the climate and current season). After selecting them the users can add them to their seed calendar. The calendar will tell the users exactly in which time of year the seeds should be seeded and when they will be ready for harvest. The website will also include some tips and tricks for gardening which will help the users with any problems they may have.
